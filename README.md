# PhotoshopImageToTileLayersForAssetGenerator
This is a simple script for photoshop, which asks for vertical and horiontal tiles, produces layers with those inputs and renames them to .jpg, so that the Photoshop: File > Generate > Image Assets can automatically generate tiles out of it. It will generate the tiles to an asset folder where the .psd is saved.
